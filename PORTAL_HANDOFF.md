# EWP Management Portal — Phase 2 Handoff

**Canonical release:** V1.0 Phase 2, shared Supabase implementation.
**Protected components:** EWP Forecast V0.27; Project Tracker V0.5 interface/workflow.

## Architecture

- Root `index.html` is the navigation portal.
- `forecast/` contains **Forecast V0.27 application code with only Phase 1 navigation and a Phase 2 intake metadata-prefill safeguard**; its existing `projects` table is the authoritative registry.
- `tracker/app.js` is a module: it calls `tracker/cloud.mjs` for all shared data and RPCs and imports `forecast/auth.mjs` for the same Supabase session. No Tracker project or settings writes use browser localStorage.
- SQL: `phase2_migration.sql` at the repository root; incremental migration on top of `forecast/supabase_v0_26.sql`. It is deliberately non-destructive.
- Tracker stores new fields directly in existing `projects` columns prefixed `tracker_`; tasks are in `tracker_work_items` with `project_id` foreign key; global lists in `tracker_settings`; filters in `tracker_saved_filters`; issued-number high water in `tracker_number_sequences`.
- New PDF projects are automatically given an `Assign task` tracker work item through a projects trigger. Existing Forecast projects are backfilled likewise. Tracker's transactional save replaces any placeholder work item with its submitted tasks.

## Key invariants

1. **Two routes to project creation**: in Tracker create TCYYXXX; in Forecast import Javelin PDF and preserve its original project number. Forecast revision/import logic matches number and adds/reconciles levels on existing shared `projects` row.
2. Server-side RPC `tracker_save_project` locks the year number sequence, honors manually selected suffixes with uniqueness protection, allocates default numbers on server, and validates optimistic project version on edits. All work items are updated in the same transaction.
3. Tracker cannot delete projects with linked Forecast levels, or rename a number that has levels. A project edit must not overwrite Forecast's `project_type` classification where it already has levels. Material and work item statuses are separate.
4. **Do not delete or change Forecast tables/functions/triggers** when developing Tracking. Read `forecast/EWP_FORECAST_HANDOFF.md` before any changes to the Forecast logic.
5. Shared login is through `forecast/auth.mjs` and the origin-scoped localStorage session key. Full portal auth navigation and security controls are Phase 3.
6. New tracking tables use the existing permissive RLS authenticated-team model. Production-hardening or individual row permissions require a separate design.

## Testing and deployment

- Run Phase 2 SQL in the existing Supabase project before pushing the frontend.
- Test Tracker sign in/restore, cloud read, create/edit/delete non-Forecast project, settings persisting on reload, drag Queue → In Progress → Done, cross-browser visibility, and duplicate number races.
- Test Forecast import new projects and import PDF to existing Tracker project, including revisions, Spruce and delivery data retention.
- Syntax checks of `tracker/app.js`, `tracker/cloud.mjs` and original Forecast modules passed. Local graphical browser testing was blocked by the environment (`ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ADMINISTRATOR`), so don't claim production end-to-end verification.
- Data formerly stored only in Tracker V0.5 browser localStorage are not auto-migrated. Existing sales names present in Forecast projects seed Tracker settings on first migration.
- Deploy root contents to GitHub Pages; leave `.nojekyll` in root.
